              Single-vision refers to a type of prescription lens that corrects
              vision for one specific distance, either for near vision (reading)
              or distance vision (seeing far away). Single-vision lenses have a
              single prescription power throughout the entire lens.

              Blue rays can negatively impact eye health by contributing to
              digital eye strain, disrupting sleep patterns, and potentially
              increasing the risk of age-related macular degeneration.

              crucial for maintaining optimal vision and overall eye health.

              To clean your glasses effectively, start by using a clean
              microfiber cloth to wipe them. If necessary, rinse them with
              lukewarm water and a small amount of mild dish soap, then dry
              gently with the cloth. Finally, store your glasses in a clean case
              to keep them protected when not in use.
